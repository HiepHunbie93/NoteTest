# Android Application Name

## Architecture, Frameworks, and Libraries Used

### Approach Taken

In this application, we have adopted the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture. MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). The view model serves as an intermediary between the view and the model, and is responsible for handling the view logic.

### Why MVVM?

- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the UI from the business logic, we make our code more manageable and modular.
- **Ease of Testing**: With business logic separated from UI logic, writing unit tests becomes significantly easier.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes in the business logic do not directly affect the UI code and vice versa.

### Frameworks and Libraries Used

- **Hilt**: For dependency injection. Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- **LiveData and ViewModel**: Part of Android Jetpack, these components help to develop lifecycle-aware applications. They allow the UI to observe changes in the application's data.
- **Data Binding**: To bind UI components in layouts to data sources, reducing the boilerplate code in activities/fragments.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplifies the implementation of navigation in the app.
- **Material Design Components**: To ensure that the app conforms to the Material Design guidelines, enhancing the UI/UX.
- **Mockito**: For mocking objects in unit tests. Mockito is a popular mocking framework for unit tests in Java and Android applications.

## Future Enhancements

Given more time, here are some functionalities and technical details I would like to add:

1. **Offline Support**: Implementing a local database, possibly with Room, to cache data locally. This would allow the app to be functional even when offline.
2. **Advanced Networking**: Adding more robust error handling, retries, and response caching to Retrofit calls.
3. **More Comprehensive Testing**: Expanding the unit and UI tests to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
4. **User Authentication**: Integrating a secure authentication mechanism for users.
5. **Dark Mode Support**: Implementing a dark mode version of the UI to adhere to modern app standards and user preferences.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Profiling the app to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
7. **ProGuard**: Implementing ProGuard for code obfuscation and optimization to enhance app security and reduce APK size.
8. **Security Enhancements**: Adding additional security measures, such as SSL pinning and encryption of sensitive data stored locally.
9. **Firebase Crashlytics**: Integrating Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app crashes and issues in real-time, allowing for quicker debugging and resolution of problems.
